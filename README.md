i got my hair done yesterday and i think my hair dresser made my highlights slightly more golden than the cooler blonde from before, i dunno its ok its fine, im not doing too much today but there could be pictures over the weekend and then my brother comes back from italy over the weekend as well

i have things to do now, tomorrow i will fix up my CV its been awhile

- [ ] i gotta update my blog to the new version of Ghost, sometime this week
- [ ] sign up for the NYT crossword, i use to enjoy that

i guess i could have said more, i could have said way more lol ahahaha

as someone who use to be obsessed with european history in hs and a little at rutgers, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillory this needs to come back, we need to do this again

i dont think the ottomans did this tho, i think shaming others publically wasnt a good thing, i dunno, but like, something like that should exist

but like, we're dealing with someone who may get off on the humiliation so i dunno, thats why i kept the voicenote short bc he replay it over and over again and get off on it hahahahahaha so sad peoples lives ahhhhhhh

- [ ] ok so this is the brush i need according to tiktok to do the eyeliner better, i think the brush i was using was thicker https://www.maccosmetics.com/product/13804/823/products/brushes-tools/brushes/eye-brushes/263-synthetic-small-angle-brush im gonna get it tomorrow morning, oh man the mac store is in that american dream mall in north jersey im pretty sure, i just dont want to go to the mall tomorrow its sunday prolly will just order it, going to sleep
